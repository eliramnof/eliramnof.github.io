I am a research fellow in the Mathematical Oncology Initiative, [Memorial Sloan Kettering Research Center](https://www.mskcc.org/research/ski), New York City, hosted by [Allen Tannenbaum](https://www.mskcc.org/profile/allen-tannenbaum) and [Joseph Deasy](https://www.mskcc.org/research-areas/labs/joseph-deasy). 

I received my Ph.D. from the [Faculty of Biomedical Engineering](https://bme.technion.ac.il/en/) at the [Technion - Israel Institute of Technology](https://www.technion.ac.il/) in Haifa, Israel. Prior to that, I received a M.Sc. and B.Sc. in Mechanical Engineering at [Ben-Gurion University of the Negev](https://in.bgu.ac.il/en/) in an accelerated track (Meitar program). 

I have worked on a diverse set of applied, high-impact problems relating to flow physics using a combination of experimental, computational, and theoretical tools:

Blastwave phenomena and hypersonic fluid-structure interactions for military and defense applications. 

Laminar to low Reynolds turbulent flows in the human respiratory system for pharmacology and disease modeling, including airborne viral transmission. 

More recently, I have been working on modeling flows in the tumor microenvironment of cancer patients for improved prediction, leveraging advanced image analysis tools and machine learning.
