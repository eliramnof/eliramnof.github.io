I am a research fellow at the Mathematical Oncology Initiative, [Memorial Sloan Kettering Research Center](https://www.mskcc.org/research/ski) in New York, hosted by [Allen Tannenbaum](https://www.mskcc.org/profile/allen-tannenbaum) and [Joseph Deasy](https://www.mskcc.org/research-areas/labs/joseph-deasy). 

I received my PhD from the [Faculty of Biomedical Engineering](https://bme.technion.ac.il/en/) at the [Technion - Israel Institute of Technology](https://www.technion.ac.il/) in Haifa, Israel. Prior to that, I received a M.Sc. and B.Sc. in Mechanical Engineering at [Ben-Gurion University of the Negev](https://in.bgu.ac.il/en/) as part of a special fast track (Meitar program).
